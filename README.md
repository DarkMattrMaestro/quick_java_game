## What is this

I was bored today and decided to check how much Java I remembered. I had not written Java in a fair while. As it turns out, I remembered enough to make a small game in a day with a few interesting features.

I did not focus on gameplay, rather, I added small features like a simple form of localization using JSON files. Don't expect much from this, it can barely be considered a game. The only "game" mechanic, that being recoil from a failed attack (think of the struggle move in Pokemon), serves to end the game so that I could focus on other aspects of the program.

## Running the Game

Run the `run.ps1` file to run the game. In your console of choice, cd into the `quick_java_game` directory then type `.\run.ps1`.

Alternatively, in a console in the same directory, type `chcp 65001` then `mvn exec:java -e`.
